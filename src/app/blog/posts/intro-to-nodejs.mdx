# Intro to Nodejs.

Hello everyone!

In this module, I’m going to explain the nitty-gritty of Node JS with some diagrams and illustrations. If you want to understand the architecture of Node JS and know how things work behind the scenes, then you are in the right place.

## Why do we need Node.js?

Nowadays a website is not just a piece of HTML and CSS with some JavaScript implementation — it has become a basic necessity of any software industry or even an individual, which provides functionality not less than any software or app.  
Functionality is nothing but just a manipulation of data; manipulating and storing data can’t all be done on the client-side — so we need another networking solution, which is called a server.

Earlier, web developers had to learn two languages: one for a website (JavaScript) and another for the backend. But after the release of Node.js people can build a server with JavaScript easily. This is not only a benefit for developers, Node.js also brought some more features and built-in modules to make development easier.

### Features of Node.js:
1. Built-in modules e.g., `fs`, `path`, `crypto`, etc.  
2. Non-blocking request system.  
3. Asynchronous, multi-threading (external module required).  
4. Fast because of the Google V8 engine.

Node is built on top of the Google Chrome JavaScript engine (V8) with network task handler libuv, and some featured modules like `fs`, `path`, etc.

### Features of libuv:
- Event-driven asynchronous I/O model is integrated.  
- It allows the CPU and other resources to be used simultaneously while still performing I/O operations.  
- Provides functionalities to run I/O and other activities using callback-based notifications.  
- It handles services like file systems, DNS, network, pipes, signal handling, streaming, etc.

Next: I will explain each built-in Node.js module — so please do follow for future articles and don’t forget to share and like. If you have any queries or suggestions please feel free to comment down below.

Thank you!
